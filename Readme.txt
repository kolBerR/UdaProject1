Relook at 2017 StackOverflow survey - a small firm searching for talent

The following analysis was done from the perspective of a small-sized IT firm trying to get insights on talent selection and retention form the 2017 StackOverflow survey result.

Installation

We used python version 3.10.8 with standard libraries coming with anaconda distribution. Most of the analysis was done with the help of the Pandas and Sklearn libraries.


Project Motivation

This excercise was done as part of my Udacity DataScientist course. The angle I took focuses on trying to understand how a small IT firm would use the 2017 StackOverflow survey to get insight for its talent hiring and retention strategy. 

File Description

All the analysis and result of this exercise is contained in one jupyter notebook. I felt it will be easy for whoever wants to see the steps I took in reaching the final result on the project 

Feedback and follow up

I welcome feedback on this project. Considering the regression analysis did not yield any significant relationship between jobsatisfaction/career satisfaction and any of the othe explanatory variables, I welcome any feedback on how to approach the problem better.
